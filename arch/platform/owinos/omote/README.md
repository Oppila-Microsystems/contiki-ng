O-Mote is an open source, light weight and powerful development board with platform specific code. O-Mote provides the most simple and effective way to 
connect embedded applications to the cloud. The most prominent feature of O-Mote is its ultra-low power implementation with high performance.

O-Mote is specially designed for IOT based applications with on board accelerometer, pressure sensor, LDR and can communicate with other connected Moteâ€™s in 
the network and can form the mesh network. O-Mote is based on TI's CC2538 SoC (System on Chip), featuring an ARM Cortex-M3 running at 32 MHz and with 32 Kb ofRAM and 512 Kb of FLASH. O-Mote can be powered through USB or through any other power sources



    * Small form factor (size: 43mm x 34mm)
    * ARM Cortex-M3 with 512KB flash and 32KB RAM
    * On board sensors BMP180(Pressure sensor), ADXL345(Accelerometer) and LDR
    * 13 GPIO pinouts to interface digital & analog sensors and actuators
    * On-board PCB Antenna
    * On-board USB to UART bridge to flash over micro-USB connector
    * Micro USB for power and programming
    * Onboard JTAG connector for programming and Debugging
    * User and Reset switch
    * ISM 2.4-GHz IEEE 802.15.4 & Zigbee compliant
    * AES-128/256, SHA2 Hardware Encryption Engine
    * ECC-128/256, RSA Hardware Acceleration Engine for Secure Key Exchange
    * Wide input range 3.7-30V

Port Features

The omote has the following key features:

  * Deep Sleep support with RAM retention for ultra-low energy consumption.
  * Native USB support (CDC-ACM). SLIP over UART for border routers is no longer a bottleneck.
  * DMA transfers for increased performance (RAM to/from RF, RAM to/from USB).

The omote has 13 pinouts to connect boolean,digital and analog sensors based on I2C,UART,and SPI Protocols as well as other sensors or actuators you may need to connect.
