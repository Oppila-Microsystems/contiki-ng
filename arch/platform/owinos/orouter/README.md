O-Router is an Ultra-Low power development board specially designed for IoT based applications, which is an open source routing device that forwards data packets between networks. This provides the most simple and effective way to connect group of nodes to cloud by establishing mesh network. O-Router is capable of IPv4/IPv6 routing, to create commercial and industrial IoT, by establishing the connection between the WSN node/mote to cloud. 
 
O-Router is based on TI's CC2538 SoC (System on Chip), featuring an ARM Cortex-M3 running at 32 MHz and with 32 Kb of RAM and 512 Kb of FLASH. It integrates with ENC28J60 Ethernet module to connect WSN Nodes to an external network. It is fully supported by open source 6LowPAN Border router i.e. 6LBR. It can be powered through USB or through any other power sources. A JTAG connector is also available to further debugging the device.
